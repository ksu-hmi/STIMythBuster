 Curious about your health? Unsure if you would like to visit a doctor just yet? Or have an idea about your health and need clarity on what it is? The STIMythBuster is the right choice for you! 

 The STIMythBuster provides quick and thorough resources to individuals seeking information on Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI). This comprehensive information will raise awareness, educate young people, and help destigmatize the topic. To utilize the STIMythBuster, select between search pathways, “Search by STI Name” or “Search by STI Symptoms.” Once you select your pathway, the app will provide STI information or prompt additional options to narrow your search criteria.  

 What makes the STIMythBuster fun, informative, and engaging is its creative ability to provide clarification, tips, and information. In addition, the STIMythBuster connects you to appropriate resources, community centers and health care providers. As part of our future development plan, the STIMythBuster will offer an opportunity for users to chat live with a healthcare provider.
